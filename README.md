# Welcome to Alison's Square Foot Garden Planner

## The Goal
I would like to be able to drag and drop squares which, when I hover on them, pop up in tooltip the name of the plant I intend to fill the square with (e.g. "peas"). I would like the squares of soil to be *always* click-and-draggable (unlocked) and I would like them to stay put wherever I leave them withOUT having to snap to grid on my screen.

I'd like to write to the CSV file on drag, and read from the CSV file on reload.

## The Stack
I'm trying to do this as vanilla as possible, but I am indeed using jQuery for drag and drop. I would use something cleaner, but all the drag-n-drop NPM options seem to be about uploading files using drag n drop, which is not a part of this project

## Possible Extensions to This Work
It would be cool to have an upload of a plants list in CSV format and have that turn into a stack of draggable squares all on top of each other so that you can sort out your tiles of SFG plants upon initial upload.

It would also be cool to have images you took fill the square instead of a particular brown soil tile color that is the default. I would ideally do this with right-click function on the soil tile to add/change the image for that tile.
